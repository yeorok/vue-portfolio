      Front-end Web development
    </h2>

    <p>
      <strong>I specialise in applications written in <span class="red">vanilia javascript</span> and <span class="red">Vue</span>.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      My current experience and skills in front-end include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        lead TypeScript/JavaScript development: bootstraping or refactoring an existing app architecture, by improving its' extensibility and reliability;
      </li>
      <li>
        full integration of front-end development using tools like <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" rel="nofollow">Webpack</a> with features like automatic code reload, code minifications, multiple environments support,
      </li>
      <li>
        good sense of making CSS sturcture
      </li>
      <li>
        knowledge and experience in many JS ecosystem, by using many libraries like RxJS, Angular, jQuery, Handlebar, Bootstrap else was needed.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Back-end Web development
    </h2>

    <p>
      <strong>In back-end development, my current stack involves <a href="http://spring.io/" rel="nofollow">Spring MVC</a> and <a href="https://expressjs.com/" rel="nofollow">Express</a>, <a href="https://codeigniter.com/" rel="nofollow">CodeIgniter</a></strong>, .
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly every app I have done in the past had the back-end written also by me. In order to improve the development speed, performance and reliability, I have changed languages and frameworks already multiple times, from PHP to Java and now to Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, my experience and lessons I learned while doing all those apps, will stay with me and be useful forever, no matter what framework I will use in the next project.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I can do is:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        lead development of web apps in Spring mvc / Express
      </li>
      <li>
        cooperation with APIs, remote data synchronizations, cloud servers, asynchronous workers
      </li>
      <li>
        Generally for database i use <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" rel="nofollow">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/?hl=ko" rel="nofollow">Firebase Cloud Storage</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        refactoring existing applications, by improving code readibility, separating concerns into separate functions and classes, splitting out the business logic from app's views and controllers
      </li>
    </ul>

      What about dev-ops, design, UI ?
    </h2>

    <p><strong>During my time I have created and released many web services.</strong></p>

    <p>Thus, not only I have coded their back-end and front-end code, but often I also had to care about other things needed in a successful web application:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        good planning of UI and thinking how it affects the UX;
      </li>
      <li>
        consistency in design and typography;
      </li>
      <li>
        deployment to the server (e.g. using <a href="https://nginx.org/en/" rel="nofollow">Nginx</a>, <a href="http://cloud.google.com/AppEngine‎" rel="nofollow">Google App Engine</a> or <a href="" rel="nofollow">Firebase</a>) and monitor its’ processes to avoid downtimes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p>
      If your initial thought is that I just can’t be the best one in everything, it's okay. Just send the UI &amp; design job to someone else, and I can take care of all the code development.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Of course I do not always work alone.</strong> If you already have an existing team for your project, but still need someone to help it, contact me. I’ll fit into your needs.
